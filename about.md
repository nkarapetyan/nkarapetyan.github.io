I am PhD student at University of South Carolina ([USC](https://cse.sc.edu)) at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I am working in Autonomous Field Robotics Laboratory ([AFRL](http://afrl.cse.sc.edu/afrl/home/)) under supervision of [Dr. Ioannis Rekleitis](https://cse.sc.edu/~yiannisr/). My current research is on multi-agent systems. I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and it's applications in robotics and education. I believe that machine intelligence must be used to make people more productive. My main research interest lies in the intersection of machine learning with robotics.

**Research Interests:**

* Multi-robot systems, path planning, machine learning, reinforcement learning, algorithms, intelligent tutoring
