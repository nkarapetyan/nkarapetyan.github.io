I am PhD candidate at the University of South Carolina ([USC](https://cse.sc.edu)) at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I am working in Autonomous Field Robotics Laboratory ([AFRL](http://afrl.cse.sc.edu/afrl/home/)) under supervision of [Dr. Ioannis Rekleitis](https://cse.sc.edu/~yiannisr/). My current research is on area coverage both for two and three dimensional areas. The goal is to enable more efficient and task oriented coverage techniques for environmental monitoring and survey operations.

My CV can be found [here](/assets/docs/cv_Sept_2019.pdf).

**Research Interests:**

* Multi-robot systems, path planning, machine learning, reinforcement learning, algorithms.
