I am PhD candidate at the University of South Carolina ([USC](https://cse.sc.edu)) at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I am working in Autonomous Field Robotics Laboratory ([AFRL](http://afrl.cse.sc.edu/afrl/home/)) under supervision of [Dr. Ioannis Rekleitis](https://cse.sc.edu/~yiannisr/). My current research is on area coverage both for two and three dimensional areas. I want to enable more efficient and task oriented coverage techniques for environmental monitoring and survey operations.

**Research Interests:**

* Multi-robot systems, path planning, machine learning, reinforcement learning, algorithms.
