I am an Assistant Scientist at [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI)](https://www.whoi.edu/). Previously I was a a postdoctoral associate at Maryland Robotics Center at University of Maryland ([UMD](https://robotics.umd.edu/)) working with [Dr. Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha), [Dr. Pratap Tokekar](https://tokekar.com/) and [Dr. Mioa Yu](https://enme.umd.edu/clark/faculty/607/Miao-Yu) I have received my PhD from University of South Carolina ([USC](https://cse.sc.edu)) in Computer Science. I was working in Autonomous Field Robotics Laboratory ([AFRL](http://afrl.cse.sc.edu/afrl/home/)) under supervision of [Dr. Ioannis Rekleitis](https://cse.sc.edu/~yiannisr/). 

My research is on area coverage both for two and three dimensional areas, with particular applications in aquatic domain. I want to enable more efficient and task oriented coverage techniques for environmental monitoring and survey operations. I sometimes draw inspiration from human expertise in performing specific tasks and try to adapt similar reasoning in algorithms I am developing for surface and underwater robots.

**Research Interests:**

* exploration, path planning, marine robotics, multi-robot systems, autonomous systems
