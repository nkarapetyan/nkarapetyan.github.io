## What is Different About Being Underwater?

### Seeing Under Water

* To focus under water, our eyes need an air space in front of them, just as they do on land. This is why we wear dive masks.
* As light passes from the water, through the mask lens and into the air space inside, it bends — a process known as refraction. This creates a magnifying effect.
* Under water, objects appear 25 percent closer and one-third larger than they do on land.


### Color Under Water

* As light passes through water, the water absorbs much of its color.
* Reds are the first to disappear, followed by oranges, yellows, greens and other colors of the spectrum.
* At a depth of 30 m/99 ft, little color remains other than blues, grays, blacks and whites.
* Dive lights help restore the colors an object would display if closer to the surface.
* Suspended particles, known as turbidity, not only reduce visibility, they can also affect color under water.


### Sound Under Water

* Because water is about 800 times denser than air, it conducts sound both farther and faster than air does.
* Sound waves move approximately four times faster in water than in air.
* Above water, we are able to determine a sound’s direction by the minute difference between when a sound arrives at one ear and when it arrives at the other.
* Under water, sounds arrive at our ears almost simultaneously, making it difficult to determine the direction from which a sound is coming.
* This can be a problem when there is a boat over head, as it may be difficult to determine how close the boat is, or the direction it is traveling. The best thing to do when you hear a boat is to remain close to the bottom until the sound disappears and then surface by your dive float or your own dive vessel.

### Staying Warm

* Water conducts heat away from the body about 25 times faster than air does.
* Knowledgeable divers seldom wear anything less than a full-length, 3mm wetsuit regardless of how warm the water may seem.
* Even with proper insulation, lengthy exposure to water can cause you to become chilled. When you feel yourself begin to shiver, get out of the water, dry off and seek warmth.

### Thermocline

* An abrupt change in water temperature is called a thermocline.

### Summary of Key Points

* Under water objects appear 25 percent closer and one third larger than they do in air.
* As you descend, water absorbs color, starting with reds and moving through the spectrum.
* Sound moves through water four times faster than it does in air. This makes it difficult to determine the direction from which a sound is coming.
* Water conducts heat away from your body 25 times faster than air does. This makes thermal protection essential — even in seemingly warm water.
* Water often stratifies itself into layers by temperature. The boundary between these layers is called a thermocline. Surface temperature may not be a good indicator of the type of exposure protection you will need at depth.


## Water in Motion

### Tides

Tides are the steady rise and fall in water level that results from the gravitational pull of the moon and sun on large bodies of water. The moon is the more powerful force of the two, pulling water outward as the Earth rotates

### Currents

Longshore Current: A longshore current runs parallel to the shoreline. Longshore currents are generally caused by waves approaching the shore at an angle — although factors such as tides and the presence of permanent offshore currents may play a factor. Plan your dive so that your entry is well up-current of your exit point.
![placeholder](https://www.tdisdi.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/owsd_elearning_longshore-261x300.jpg)

Rip Currents: A rip current, or run-out, is a narrow flow of swiftly moving water that runs perpendicular to shore and can quickly pull people out to sea. Rip currents are formed when water flowing out to the sea is funneled through a narrow restriction, such as between two sandbars or a break in a coral reef. The force of a rip current is diminished as it dumps into deeper water, generally not far beyond the surf zone.

You can identify a rip current by a stream of foamy turbid water running perpendicular to shore. If you are caught in a rip current, the best thing to do is to swim parallel to shore (perpendicular to the current) until you reach an area free of the rip current. Then swim toward shore.

### Waves 

Waves are formed by wind pushing water on the surface. The size of a wave generally depends on fetch — how hard and long the wind has been blowing and the distance the wind has traveled without being obstructed. The greater the fetch, the larger the wave. A wave’s height is measured from its highest point, the crest, to its lowest point, the trough. The distance from the crest of one wave to the crest of the next wave is called the wavelength.

### Surf 

When the waves encounter shallow water, the bottom of the wave starts to slow down and the top becomes too steep and unstable. Breaking waves at a shoreline are called surf, which is water that moves up onto shore and back out to sea.
![placeholder](https://www.tdisdi.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/00713.jpg)

### Surge

Deep under water, you cannot feel wave action on the surface. However, in shallow water, when there are waves overhead, you will likely experience surge. Surge is the back and forth motions of water caused by wave action. Surge can pose a threat when diving a shallow water reef with many coral or rock formations. Under such conditions, it is best to move away from underwater formations and into deeper water where the surge is weaker.

### Summary of Key Points

* Tides can affect depth, current and visibility.
* The sun warming ocean water at the equator, coupled with the earth’s rotation, causes most permanent ocean currents.
* Longshore currents can be created by wind, tides, waves and the presence of nearby ocean currents.
* A rip current is a narrow flow of swiftly moving water that runs perpendicular to shore.
* The most effective way to get out of a rip current is to swim perpendicular to the current (parallel to shore).
* Wind is the primary cause of waves.
* We measure waves by their height (trough to crest) and length (crest to crest).
* As waves approach shore, the bottom of the wave slows, causing the top to break and form surf.
* Surge is the back-and-forth movement of water caused by waves passing over head.

## Aquatic Life Interaction

### Summary of Key Points
* Aquatic life injuries are most often a result of diver carelessness.
* The most common aquatic life injuries are scrapes and abrasions.
* Some animals possess stinging cells called nematocysts. These include species of jellyfish and fire coral.
* Other animals, such as scorpion-fish and lion-fish, possess poisonous spines. These are purely a defensive mechanism.
* Aquatic animal bites are rare, and are almost always a result from an animal’s defensive response to a perceived threat, or by mistaken identity.
* If you plan to dive in an unfamiliar environment, contact your local SDI Dive Center for information and advice.

## The Science of Diving

### Summary of Key Points

* Positively buoyant items float. Negatively buoyant objects sink. Neutrally buoyant objects neither float nor sink.
* Pressure in air is the result of the weight of the atmosphere above you. Pressure under water reflects the weight of both the atmosphere and the water above you.
* Ambient (surrounding) pressure increases by one atmosphere (one bar) for every 10 m/33 ft of descent in sea water.
* The volume of a gas in a flexible container (such as air in the lungs) is inversely proportional to the increase or decrease in ambient pressure. At a depth of two atmospheres (10 m/33 ft), this volume will be half of what it was at the surface. Conversely, if you take a gas-filled, flexible container with a volume of one unit at a depth of 30 m/99 ft to the surface, where the ambient pressure is only one fourth of what it was at depth, the volume of the container will expand to four units.
* The density of gas molecules in a flexible container is directly proportional to changes in pressure. At a depth of 20 m/66 ft, where the ambient pressure is three times greater than at the surface, air molecules in your lungs will be packed three times more closely together. This means, among other things, that you will consume three times as much air at 20 m/66 ft as you do at the surface.
* So long as air can transfer freely between body air spaces, the air spaces will adjust automatically to changes in depth and pressure. A notable exception is the middle ears. To avoid a potentially serious condition known as an ear squeeze, you need to equalize early and often during descent, and never descend past the point at which you can comfortably equalize.
* You can help ensure the automatic equalization of other body air spaces, such as the sinuses, by breathing continuously and not diving with a cold or congestion. Exhaling periodically into your mask during descent will help prevent mask squeeze; regular, professional dental care will help prevent tooth squeeze.
* Should you suffer a reverse block during ascent, stop, descend to a point where the pain disappears, yawn and/or swallow to help open the eustachian tubes, then ascend slowly.
* The single most important rule of scuba diving is breathe continuously, never hold your breath. Any time you can’t inhale, exhale.
* Breath holding on ascent puts you at risk of a lung over-pressure (over-expansion) injury. The most serious of these is Arterial Gas Embolism (AGE — also known as an air embolism), which can be fatal.

## Breathing Air Under Water

### Summary of Key Points

* The key components of air are oxygen and nitrogen. For dives made within recreational limits, oxygen poses no risk; however, breathing nitrogen under pressure can cause problems.
* At depth, your body absorbs nitrogen from the air you breathe. So long as you keep the amount of nitrogen absorbed within certain limits, and ascend slowly, this additional nitrogen poses little risk. However, if you exceed these limits or ascend too quickly, nitrogen coming out of solution can form bubbles that put pressure on nerves or block the flow of blood to vital tissues. This causes what is known as decompression sickness.
* In addition to staying well within your dive computer’s no-decompression limits and following its ascent-rate guidelines, you can reduce the risk of decompression sickness by: making safety stops; avoiding sawtooth profiles, dehydration, exertion and cold; and by not flying or driving to altitude until your body has had the opportunity to off-gas sufficient nitrogen.
* Signs and symptoms of decompression sickness include pain in the joints, rash, difficulty breathing, dry cough, dizziness, numbness, tingling, paralysis, temporary blindness and unconsciousness. Treatment includes: administering pure oxygen, activating the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) system, notifying the Diver’s Alert Network (DAN) and, possibly, treatment in a recompression chamber.
* Breathing nitrogen under pressure brings with it the risk of nitrogen narcosis which can impair judgment, coordination and perception. You can best avoid the consequences of nitrogen narcosis by avoiding dives below 20 m/66 ft until you gain further training and experience. Nevertheless, if you suspect narcosis in yourself or a buddy, ascend until the symptoms disappear.
* Contaminated air carries with it the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. Do not use air if it has a color, odor or taste. If you experience headache, nausea or similar ill feelings under water ascend immediately.

## Personal Dive Equipment

### Summary of Key Points

* Masks allow you to see under water by creating an air space in front of your eyes that allows them to focus.
* A mask needs to cover your nose so that you keep the pressure inside the mask equal to the water pressure outside.
* Important mask features include: a soft, silicone skirt; a snug, comfortable fit; a low internal volume; a wide field of vision; and, an adjustable strap.
* Snorkels may be useful on long surface swims because they give you the option to swim face down without using air from your cylinder.
* Fins are available in full-foot and open-heel (adjustable) models. Because they are not designed to be used with wet suit boots, full-foot fins are not well suited for diving in cold water or from rocky shores.
* Post-dive maintenance and care for nearly all dive equipment includes: rinsing thoroughly in fresh water; allowing to dry thoroughly; and, storing in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.
* Common exposure suit types include dive skins, wet suits and dry suits.
* Dive skins can help protect against sun, scrapes and abrasions; however, they offer little in the way of thermal protection.
* Wet suits surround divers in one or more layers of low-density, neoprene foam insulation. To work, however, they must fit snugly.
* For water below 10 °C/50 °F, dry suits are all but essential.
* Your body loses more heat through the head than any other extremity. Wetsuit hoods and gloves are essential in water below 20 °C/68 °F (most divers will begin wearing hoods and gloves before this).

## Scuba Unit

### 

* A BC functions as a harness, an attachment point for accessories and may have pockets to store other items. Its air cell enables you to float at the surface and compensate for exposure suit compression at depth.
* BCs are available in jacket-style (wrap around) models and back-inflation units.
* BC features may include: various power inflation/deflation options; an integrated weight system; pockets; and, various remote exhaust valves.
* Weight system options may include weight-integrated BCs and conventional weight belts. Integrated-weight BCs have become the more popular of the two, for reasons ranging from comfort and convenience, to the fact they give divers the option to drop some or most of their weight in an emergency.
* A scuba regulator’s primary function is to reduce high-pressure air to ambient pressure, making it as easy to breathe under water as at the surface.
* A typical scuba regulator system will consist of a primary second stage, an alternate-air-source second stage, a submersible pressure gauge and/or instrument console, and a low-pressure inflator hose for the BC and, possibly, a dry suit.
* Almost any regulator provides adequate performance for recreational scuba diving. Among the most important features to consider when selecting a regulator is the availability of regular, professional maintenance to keep the regulator functioning in “as new” condition.
* Scuba cylinders are available in aluminum and steel, and come in a variety of working pressures and capacities.
* Scuba cylinders require periodic hydrostatic testing and visual inspection. The specific intervals will depend on local laws and regulations, and prevailing standards of practice.

## Instrumentation and Accessories

###

* Submersible pressure gauges (SPGs) help you avoid running out of air by allowing you to monitor your cylinder pressure while under water.
* Dive computers monitor your exposure to nitrogen by tracking your depth and time and comparing this data with a theoretical model. They are more convenient and, in many respects, safer than relying on dive tables.
* As a minimum, when in Dive mode, virtually all dive computers will tell you: your current depth; your maximum depth; your actual dive time; and, your remaining no-decompression dive time (no-decompression limit or NDL). Should you accidentally exceed your no-decompression limit, you computer will tell you the depths at which you need to make mandatory decompression stops, and for how long.
* At the surface, your computer will most likely provide you with information on: surface interval; projected no-decompression limits for upcoming dives; and, dive log data on recent dives.
* Additional desirable features your computer may possess include: automatic activation; Nitrox capability; and, PC upload capability.
* Compasses help divers avoid the need for long surface swims by allowing them to navigate under water, even when there are no natural navigation landmarks present.
* Compasses will typically have: a north-pointing needle or compass card; a rotating bezel or index marks; a reciprocal mark; and a center (lubber) line.
* Surface/rescue signals can include surface marking tubes and audible signals, such as whistles.
* A dive knife or cutting tool is intended chiefly as a means for dealing with entanglement.
* Dive lights are essential on night dives and can help divers look into cracks and crevices, and restore missing color at depth during the day.
* Loose equipment can easily become lost or damaged. Always pack and carry dive equipment in a proper gear bag.
* Dive flags warn boaters that there are divers in the water. They include the red-and-white ‘diver down’ flag and the international, blue-and-white alpha flag.
* A log book is a permanent record of your personal diving experience. Just as a resume documents your real-world job experience after you get your diploma, your dive log documents your real-world dive experience after you get your certification card. Many dive operators are more concerned with what your log book says than they are with how many certification cards you have.
* Slates provide a means to communicate with buddies when hand signals will not suffice. They can also record data for later transfer to a log book.

## Equipment Assembly and Disassembly

###

* Prior to assembling your scuba unit, check the valve O-ring and, if possible, soak the BC cam band to allow it to stretch.
* Orient the scuba cylinder with the valve orifice facing away from you. When attaching the regulator, make sure the second stages are on the right, and the instruments and low-pressure inflator hose on the left.
* Face the SPG down when turning the air on.
* Breathe from the regulator while watching the pressure gauge to ensure the air is turned all the way on.
* For better accessibility, to help prevent entanglement and to protect your equipment and the environment from damage, make sure your alternate-air-source second stage and instrument console are clipped off to your BC harness.
* When donning equipment out of water, the stronger buddy should don his scuba unit first, then help the weaker buddy into his.
* Review the ABCs before each dive: Air on, BC inflated and Computer activated and functioning.
* General rules for entries include: Keep your regulator in your mouth; have your BC at least partially inflated; and, make sure the area immediately below the entry point is clear.
* Common entries include: giant strides; controlled seated entries; back rolls; shore (non-surf) entries; and, surf entries.
* Common exits include: deep water/ladder exits; small boat exits; and, surf/shore exits.
* When disassembling your scuba unit, remember to completely depressurize the regulator system before attempting to remove it from the cylinder.
* Before rinsing your regulator in fresh water, make certain the dust cap has been wiped dry with a clean, dry cloth and is securely back in place on the first stage.


## Basic Underwater Skills

###

* The key to efficient scuba use is breathing slowly and deeply.
* Snorkel clearing techniques include the blast and displacement methods.
* You can clear a regulator of water by exhaling into it or using the purge button.
* Regulator recovery techniques include the sweep and reach methods. Before attempting to recover a lost second stage you should first switch to your alternate air source.
* You can clear a mask of water by pressing the skirt against your forehead and exhaling through your nose to displace the water inside, looking up during the last breath to get the last bit of water out.
* The best place to conduct a weight check is at the end of a dive, at safety-stop depth. If you are wearing the right amount of weight, you should be able to hover motionless with no air in your BC, regardless of the type of exposure suit worn.
* The key to BC deflation, at the surface or under water, is knowing how to position your body so that the exhaust valve is the highest point on the BC.
* You can inflate a BC, on the surface or under water, orally or by using the power inflator. The power inflator is the easiest and most convenient method.
* When adding air to a BC under water do so only in small bursts and be ready to vent the BC immediately should you accidentally add too much.
* Among the key points in a descent: agree with your buddy to descend; orient yourself to an object at the surface; equalize early and often; stay with your buddy; and, add air to your BC as needed so that you arrive at the bottom neutrally buoyant.
* When making an ascent: agree with your buddy to ascend; confirm your deco status on your dive computer; ascend no faster than your or your buddy’s most conservative computer allows, venting air from your BC as needed to control your rate of ascent; and, make a safety stop of from three to five minutes at a depth of between 3-6 m/10-20 ft.
* Breath control involves making minor adjustments in your mid-tidal volume to make temporary adjustments in your overall buoyancy.
* If your buoyancy is under control all you need to do to hover is to stop swimming.
* The three As of buoyancy control are: Awareness of changes in depth; Anticipation of the need to add or vent air; and, taking Action to vent or add air to your BC as needed.
* The key points in performing a flutter kick are to keep your knees straight, toes pointed and kick from the hip.
* Hand signals provide among the fastest and most convenient ways to signal to your buddy under water.
